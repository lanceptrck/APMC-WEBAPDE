"Rock Lobster" is a song written by Fred Schneider and Ricky Wilson, two members of The B-52's. It was produced in two versions, one by DB Records released in 1978, and a longer version, which was part of the band's 1979 self-titled debut album, released by Warner Bros.[5] The song became one of their signature tunes[6] and it helped launch the band's success. <br><br>"Rock Lobster" was the band's first single to appear on Billboard Hot 100, where it reached No. 56. A major hit in Canada, the single went all the way to No. 1 in the RPM national singles chart. Its follow-up was "Private Idaho," in October 1980, which reached No. 74 in the US. It was well received by critics and was placed at No. 147 on Rolling Stone's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time". <br><br>The DB Records single version lasts 4'37" and is rawer and faster than the 1979 Warner single version. It has, however, almost the same lyrics of the second version, just including some extra lines in the listing of marine animals. The 1979 single version itself is an edit from the album version released in 1979, which lasts about seven minutes and contains an extra verse. <br><br>Its lyrics include nonsensical lines about a beach party and excited rants about real or imagined marine animals ("There goes a dog-fish, chased by a cat-fish, in flew a sea robin, watch out for that piranha, there goes a narwhal, here comes a bikini whale!"), accompanied by absurd, fictional noises attributed to them (provided by Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson - Pierson providing the higher-pitched noises and Wilson the lower-pitched ones); the chorus consists of the words "Rock Lobster!" repeated over and over on top of a keyboard line. <br><br>"Rock Lobster" is written in the key of C minor (with a raised fourth in the chorus) and is in common time. Instruments used in the music include a baritone-tuned surf-style Mosrite electric guitar, a Farfisa Combo Compact organ, and drums.[citation needed] Kate Pierson played the song's bass line on a Korg SB-100 "Synth Bass" synthesizer.

Most Filipinos are already familiar with the wonders of the pork sisig. Thanks to the Grey Lady, discerning New Yorkers might just give the sizzling Pinoy appetizer a try.<br><br>Sisig from Aling Lucing's in Pampanga. Photo courtesy of ‘Ang Pinaka’<br>In a piece on the New York Times last week, food columnist Ligaya Mishan sang the praises of the sisig while reviewing Lumpia Shack Snackbar, a Filipino restaurant in West Village.<br> <br>"This is sisig, the greatest pork hash — arguably greatest pork dish — on earth. Say the name with two flicks of the tongue, somewhere between a whisper and a hiss," wrote Mishan.<br> <br>She added that the sisig was "a muscle car in the world of Filipino cuisine" along with the crispy pata, which are served like fries at Lumpia Shack Snackbar.<br> <br>It's not the first time a food critic from the New York Times has raved about Filipino food. Last year, writer Pete Wells wrote glowing reviews about a pair of restaurants that served Pinoy fare in the Big Apple.<br><br><br><br><br>

And across your building (thank you, Jesus!) is a Jollibee, with a McDonald’s right beside it.<br><br>Because (1) you’re really craving for a burger (those stale biscuits stashed at your desk just won’t do), (2) you have only PHP 30 in your wallet (and the nearest ATM is two blocks away), and (3) you’re pressed for time, you’ll have to choose between the Big-Ass Bumblebee or the Creepy Smiling Clown with a Red Afro. Exactly whose hamburger is worth your remaining cash and time?<br><br>To help you with your afternoon snack dilemma, we’re pitting the two budget burgers against each other, and assessing them using five categories: General Physical Properties, Affordability, The Bun, The Spread, and The Patty.
